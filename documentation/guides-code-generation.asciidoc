= Code Generation

As we mention in the page link:guide-key-principles[key principles], one of our key principles is Productivity. In order to provide that productivity, we have some tools to generate code. These tools will help you generate the common parts of the application so that you can focus only on the specific functionality.

Those tools are:

- link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devon4node/schematics[devon4node schematics through Nest CLI]
- link:https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen[CobiGen]

== Nest CLI and Devon4node schematics
 
We are going to use the Nest CLI to generate code of our application, you can know more about NodeJs CLI in the official link:https://docs.nestjs.com/cli/overview:[documentation].

=== Install devon4node schematics

First of all, you need to install Nest CLI 

Execute the command `yarn global add @nestjs/cli`.
You can also use npm: `npm install -g @nestjs/cli`

And then Devon4node schematics globally with the following command:

`yarn global add @devon4node/schematics` or `npm install -g @devon4node/schematics`

[NOTE] 
====
If you get an error trying execute any devon4node schematic related to collection not found, try to reinstall devon4node/schematics on the project folder or be sure that schematics folder is inside @devon4node in node_modules. 
`yarn add @devon4node/schematics`
====

=== Generate new devon4node application


To start creating a devon4node application, execute the command:

`nest g -c @devon4node/schematics application [application-name]`

If you do not put a name, the command line will ask you for one.

=== Generate code for TypeORM

Initialize TypeORM into your current project in a correct way.

`nest g -c @devon4node/schematics typeorm`

Then, you will be asked about which DB you want to use.

=== Generate CRUD

Generate CRUD methods for a entity. Requires TypeORM installed in the project.

It will add the @nestjsx/crud module as a project dependency. Then, generates an entity, a CRUD controller and a CRUD service. It also register the entity, controller and service in the module.

Execute `nest g -c @devon4node/schematics crud` and then you will need to write a name for the crud.

=== Generate TypeORM entity

Add a TypeORM entity to your project. Requires TypeORM installed in the project.

Execute `nest g -c @devon4node/schematics entity` and you will be asked for an entity name.

=== Add config-module

Add the config module to the project.

It will add the @devon4node/common module as a project dependency. Then, it will generate the configuration module into your project and add it in the core module. Also, it generates the config files for the most common environments.

The command to execute will be `nest g -c @devon4node/schematics config-module`

=== Add mailer module

Add @devon4node/mailer module to project.

It will add the @devon4node/mailer module as a project dependency. Also, it will add it to the core module and it will generate some email template examples.

Write the command `nest g -c @devon4node/schematics mailer`


=== Add swagger module

Add swagger module to project.

It will add the @nestjs/swagger module as a project dependency. Also, it will update the main.ts file in order to expose the endpoint for swagger. The default endpoint is: /v1/api

Execute the command `nest g -c @devon4node/schematics swagger`

=== Add auth-jwt module

Add the auth JWT module to the project.

It will add to your project the auth-jwt and user module. Also, it will import those modules into the core module.

Execute `nest g -c @devon4node/schematics auth-jwt`

=== Add security

Add cors and helmet to your project.

It will add helmet package as project dependency and update the main.ts file in order to enable the cors and helmet in your application.

Execute `nest g -c @devon4node/schematics security`

=== Generate database migrations

. Generate database migrations
.. In order to create migration scripts with TypeORM, you need to install ts-node: `yarn global add ts-node` or `npm i -g ts-node`
.. Generate the tables creation migration: `yarn run typeorm migration:generate -n CreateTables`
+
image::images/insert-data.PNG[]
It will connect to the database, read all entities and then it will generate a migration file with all sql queries need to transform the current status of the database to the status defined by the entities. If the database is empty, it will generate all sql queries need to create all tables defined in the entities. You can find a example in the todo example

As TypeORM is the tool used for DB. You can check official documentation for more information. 
See link:https://typeorm.io/#/using-cli[TypeORM CLI documentation].

== CobiGen

Currently, we do not have templates to generate devon4node code (we have planned to do that in the future). Instead, we have templates that read the code of a devon4node application and generate a devon4ng application. Visit the link:https://github.com/devonfw/cobigen[CobiGen] page for more information.
